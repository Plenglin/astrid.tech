# About Me

Hey, I'm Astrid and I'm a programmer. I got into coding when I was around 12, back when I played a ton of Minecraft. There was this mod to the game called [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) that added computers to the game. I thought that was really cool, so I ended up teaching myself Lua to program those computers. That ended up blossoming into the 7-year-long-and-counting mess that you can see on the [Projects page](/projects).

I'm currently a CS student at Cal Poly, slated to graduate in 2023 unless a certain infectious disease has a say in that. I started this blog because I wanted a place to keep track of and post progress reports on some of the projects I'm working on. If you find some of them to be particularly interesting, feel free to contact me through any of the following channels!
