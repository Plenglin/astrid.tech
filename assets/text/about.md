# About Me

Hey, I'm Astrid and I'm a programmer. I got into coding when I was around 12, back when I played a ton of Minecraft. There was this mod for the game called [ComputerCraft](http://www.computercraft.info/) that added computers to the game. I thought that was really cool, so I ended up teaching myself Lua to program those computers.

Later on, I started branching out into more and more languages, technologies, and projects, and I eventually ended up with the 7-year-long-and-counting mess that you can see on the [Projects page](/projects). I wanted a place to share and show off all of these projects, so I created this website!

I'm currently interning at Micro-Vu Corporation in Windsor, CA. I'm also a CS student at Cal Poly, slated to graduate in 2023 unless a certain virus has something to say about that. If you find the things I do to be particularly interesting, or you just want to chat (I'm all for a nice socially-distanced conversation), feel free to contact me through any of the following channels!
