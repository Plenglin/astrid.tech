Back in 6th grade, I wanted to make a Minecraft mod. I tried to teach myself Java... and completely failed at it. But in the process, I discovered what I was born to do: programming. With a few lines of code, I could make the computer do all sorts of amazing things, and as a little bonus, solve all sorts of homework problems.

I built more and more projects over time, learning about new topics with each project. As a computer science student at California Polytechnic State University, San Luis Obispo, I’m expanding my knowledge further through the school’s tradition of Learn By Doing. At the various internships I’ve worked at, I’m applying my knowledge to create software that helps people get what they want to do, done.

In my spare time, I like to work on software projects to sharpen my mind and skills, like this very website. When I'm not inventing new things, you can catch me cooking and sampling foods from various different cuisines, biking, or skateboarding.
